# NN - Simple neural network framework written in C

The goal is to be able to create a framework capable enough to train number recognition on MNIST database.  
This framework is made for educational purposes and is effectively a re-implementation of [Tsoding's nn.h library](https://github.com/tsoding/nn.h).
